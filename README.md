# Priority Queue in C
A Priority Queue that can take generic data using C.


As unorthodox and perhaps impractical as implementing a generic data structure in C may seem in modern times,
I felt the need to break my head as a programmer and enthusiast for C and decided to program my own
implementation of a generic priority queue in C.

NOTE: As of 4/11/23, it works with integers and strings, more modifications or additions will be added later!
